I follow the instruction to change the relative path in build.xml, folder name to wisc from brown and other thing else. After that I modify the code in LoadBalancer.java and ShortestPathSwitching.java.  Thanks to the reference. Although it used dijkstra shortest path algorithm, it taught me how to write code in ShortestPathSwitching.java. I also used the book of Fundamental of Algorithm to review the BellMan shortest algorithm.
